- ✅ Model imported in `app/models.py`
- ✅ Directory structure created

**What Needs to Be Completed:**

### 1. Google Ads API Integration (`app/ads_grader/google_ads_client.py`)

   - Check % of ETAs vs old format
   - Grade based on adoption rate

3. **Text Ad Optimization** (68% in example)
   - Analyze best/worst/average ads
   - Calculate expected vs actual CTR
   - Compare # of ads to benchmark

4. **Quality Score Optimization** (19% in example)
   - Distribution chart data
   - Calculate potential savings from QS improvement
   - Compare to industry benchmark (target 7.0)

5. **CTR Optimization** (28% in example)
